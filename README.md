Database Migration
Flyway is used for database versioning. Migrations run automatically on app start.
A default admin user is created during the initial migration.


🔑 Default Admin Credentials
⚠️ Please change the default credentials immediately after first login!

• Username: admin123@gmail.com
• Password: 123456


⚙️ Configuration
To securely connect with external services and databases, update the application configuration.

Database Configuration
Edit src/main/resources/application.properties:

spring. datasource.url=your database url
spring.datasource.username=your database username
spring.datasource.password=your database password

✉️ Mail (SMTP) Configuration
Configure your SMTP email provider for notifications:

spring.mail.host=MAIL_HOST
spring.mail.port=MAIL_PORT:587
spring.mail.username=MAIL_USERNAME
spring.mail.password=MAIL_PASSWORD
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true

☁️ Cloudinary Configuration
Used for uploading and managing expense receipt images:

cloudinary.cloud_name=CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
cloudinary.api_key=CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
cloudinary.api_secret=CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

🔐 JWT & OAuth2 Configuration
JWT secret and expiration settings:

app.jwt.secret=JWT_SECRET
app.jwt.expiration=JWT_EXPIRATION_MS


Google and GitHub OAuth2 setup (ensure redirect URIs are configured in the provider's console):

spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-id=GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-secret=GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET


👥 Usage
• Access each dashboard based on your assigned role.

• Admin users can promote others to Manager, Finance, or Admin via the Admin Dashboard.

• Role-based routing ensures proper access control throughout the app.
